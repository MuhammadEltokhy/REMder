# REMder

**REMder** â€” Your Ultimate Deadline Reminder is a small, local desktop reminder application written in Python using the Textual TUI framework and pygame for simple audio alerts. It lets you create deadline tasks, chooses sensible pre-deadline alerts, optionally associate an audio file per task, and persistently saves tasks on disk.

This README explains the design, installation, usage, file formats, and development notes so you can run, modify, or package REMder.
